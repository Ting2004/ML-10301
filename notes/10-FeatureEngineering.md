___



### Features in NLP

- handcrafted rule-based features
  - larger vector yield better result
  - but reach plateau

- word embedding, bag of word  ...

### Features in CV

- edge detection, corner detection
- convolution





## Non-linear Function

- adding more feature (polynomial features)
  - reduces the training error
  - but test error is bad?
  - **overfitting**

- more data would prevent overfitting







## Regularization

### Occam's Razor

prefer the simpler hypothesis



- cooperate a new objective function
  - penally large number of parameters
